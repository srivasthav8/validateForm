**FORM VALIDATION**

In this Small basic project, validation form is created using html5, css3, jQuery, javascript. In this validation there are three fields.

To those fields animations (like when we click it will slide down and other fileds will slide up) are applied. For animations jQuery has been 
used. Function validateForm is created using javascript. Using this function we validate the form.

There are some required fields (in html these fields have the class-req) which has to be take some input. If not it will display the alert message. And email field is validated, only validated email
addresses are taken as input. Otherwise, it will display the message to enter the correct email address.
